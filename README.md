ello's godot stash
==================
Place where I feel like making Godot stuff that are not important

Usage
-----
Each folder should be a *program*. You can load and play its `main.tscn` file.

Feel free to use the codes and assets. Theres reusable class that you can use
across your porject, stored in `./script/class/` folder.
