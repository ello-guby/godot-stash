ello's godot stash
==================
Place where I feel like making Godot stuff that are not important

Usage
-----
Each non-generic named folder and have a `main.tscn` file should
be a *program*. You can load and play its `main.tscn` file.

Feel free to use the codes and assets. Theres reusable class that
you can use across your porject, stored in `./script/class/`
folder.
